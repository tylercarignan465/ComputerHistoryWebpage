   <h2>History Of Computing</h2>

   <p>Imagine if we didn't have computers today, everything would be way harder because the
       information that is in computers is in almost all of our technology today. The history
       of computers is really interesting because they had to try and fail over and over until
       they got something that worked. In this essay you will see some of the troubles people
       had while trying invent a computer. And you can see the great success came out of the
       hard work these men had to do to let us have what we have and use today.
   </p>
<p>In 500 B.C. the history of computers was invented, that is when the abacus was invented as we
    know today as the first computer. This ancient tool was made of a wooden tablet and beans or
    stones that would move in the groves of the wood, but today they are made up "a bamboo frame
    with beads sliding on wires,"(Wikipedia). Even though today this tool is outdated, it is still
    being used by traders and merchants in places like Russia, China and Africa. There is also a
    binary abacus which shows you how computers can manipulate numbers, much like the regular
    abacus it uses bamboo and beads but it uses three rows of beads instead of one. This binary
    abacus uses letters, numbers and signs are stored in a computer.

<p>Further along a man named Charles Babbage or also known as the "father of computing" had
    invented the first mechanical computer in the early 19th century. After this movement forward
    it opened up so many doors, they could study and try new things and eventually make more
    complex computers. And because of this, he was achieving so many things, he played a big
    role in the “Association for the Advancement of Science and the Statistical Society
    (later Royal Statistical Society),”(Charles Babbage). and inventing the concept of p
    rogrammable computer.  Even with his many achievements he had some failures, for example
    when he failed to construct his calculation machine or when the government didn't want
    to support his work. Without Charles Babbage who knows when we would have discovered a
    mechanical computer.
</p>

<p>Another man that was working on  the mechanics of a computer was Herman Hollerith, He was
    the founder of the The Tabulating Machine Company. Herman Hollerith invention marked
    “the beginning of the era of semi automatic data processing systems, and his concept
    dominated that landscape for nearly a century,”(Wikipedia). Later after he began to
    experiment and expand what his invention could do like including railroad freight statistics
    exedra. But because of his emotional state he lost his job, Herman Hollerith didn't give up
    there less than 18 days later he had his machines back up on the market. Something else
    that was interesting was some of the computers he had made used UNIX which is a very
    interesting operating system.
</p>

<p>UNIX is very incredible once you learn about what it can do what how to use it, This
    operating system has came along way from when it was first made. November 3, 1971 was when
    UNIX was created and there is still a wide variety of people using it today. And because of
    the programming language that it was written with it can reach a numerous amount of platforms
    which is really convenient. And the difference between other operating system is that UNIX
    “is a family of   multitasking, multi user computer operating systems that derive from the
    original AT&T Unix,”(Wikipedia). For this software to be running on inexpensive hardware
    and do such an impact on other systems is just something to think about.

<p>After finding out all this information, it is apparent how important it was for us to invent
    computers and all the software that goes along with it. It was very interesting to find out
    that the abacus was the first computer and it was just made out of bamboo and beads. It was
    also interesting to find out that Charles Babbage and Herman Hollerith did so much to invent
    and ennovate the computer. Lastly, who knew what UNIX could do for us, and that people still
    use it today even though it was invented so long ago. The history of computers is so
    intriguing and makes you wonder what we can do with the information that we have now.
